## Syntax followed while editing readme

  + To make a Heading add the number of hashes before sentence.
  
    no of hashes before sentence = no of sub-heading you are making.

    Ex : for making heading 4 ,write (#### heading 4)
  
  + TO MAKE THE LINE A NEW SETENCE PRESS ENTER TWO TIMES.
  + To make bullets you can use sign (plus(+),minus(-),astrick) with a space before sentence.
  
    plus sign recommended.
    
  + Put two spaces in front of hypen to indent the text. Ex :
    -indented
     1. If you put the number it will give you capital case or lower case.
     
     this whole in this point is what we call a list
  + Now if we want to add a link in our repo, it can be done in two ways :
    1. [text/description](0)  , text followed by paranthesis . Ex:
       [this is the description](https://github.com/yashika0998/git-learning/edit/master/README.md), Click here to get direct on raw.
       
  + If you want to add some inline code have a (') 1 tick in that word . Ex: 'variable'
  + If you want to have a block of code have a (') 3 ticks in that . Ex: '''html
        <p>An example</p>
        '''
        
  + To put the images use syntax : ![alt text](URL). Ex: (creating a random picture)
    
    ![alt text](http://picsum.photos/200/200)
    
  + We can also add blockquote using sign (greater than). Ex :
    > blockquote created.
    | heading | header | head|
    | ... | ... | ... |
    | content | more content | text |
    
  + To bold a sentence use double astrick. Ex:
   
    ** Notes by Yashika for readme **
    
  + For italic sentence use one astrick (*). Ex:
   
    *learn then proceed*
